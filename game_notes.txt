Basically Pacman
- The walls are trees, with the exception of the centre which is rock.
- The stuff you eat are berries.
- The character is a female hunter/gatherer
- The ghosts are bears, but there are only two. The bears wander aimlessly unless they see something and
then they move towards it. Will continue in the direction unless reach a t-intersection, if see will follow, if not will wander aimlessly
- The power pills are deer. Will wander aimlessly and if there is a berry, will take it. If sees something will move away.
- If bear catches deer, will return to cave.
- Extra points for player if catch deer.
- Game ends when all berries are collected.
